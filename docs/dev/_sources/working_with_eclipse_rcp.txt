Fashions change - and the Eclipse RCP API has evolved over time. As such some of these instructions
will be dated; please make use of the Eclipse Help menu for accurate documentation that reflects the
version of Eclipse you are running with today!

As an example Eclipse 3.4 introduced a new "org.eclipse.ui.menu" extension point; use of this
extension should gradually replace the use of Actions and ActionSets.
