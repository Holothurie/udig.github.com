GIS Platform Tutorials
======================

The GIS platform is used for the catalog and data access.

GIS Platform
------------

The GIS Platform serves as the foundation of the uDig application responsible for data access. It is
the first tier of the `Platform Architecture <platform_architecture>`:

-  Custom Application
-  GIS Application
-  GIS Platform

Data Model
----------

The GIS platform works with the concept a catalog which provides access to resource "handles". Here
is how that breaks down in practice:

-  **Catalog** responsible for:

   -  Search: provides a way for developers to discovery new information
   -  Management: takes responsibility for tracking data use (add / remove and cleanup of heavy
      weight objects such as databases)

-  **Handles** to actual data and services

Inside the catalog we can start to see this idea of "handles" in action.

In the above example we have:

-  **Service** - represents a service that is publishing information
-  **GeoResource** - represents the actual spatial information

Data Access Handles
-------------------

The IService and IGeoResource objects work in a manner similar to a **File** handle. A Java File
object contains information about how to access the file; and can be used to interact with the file;
but are not actually the bytes on disk available when you "open" a file and get the input stream.

Here is how to use a getResource to access features:

.. code-block:: java

    if( geoResource.canResolve( FeatureStore.class ) ){
        FeatureSource featureSource = handle.resolve( FeatureSource.class, monitor );
        ...
    }

Both **IService** and **IGeoResource** implement **IResolve** with the following useful methods:

-  **IResolve.getID()** is a unique ID used to identify this resource
-  **IResolve.canResolve( Class type )** is a non blocking check to see if a type of resource is
   available
-  **IResolve.resolve( Class type, IProgressMonitor monitor )** will aquire the request resource;
   this method may throw an IOException as it is actually connecting to and opening the resource for
   use

Eclipse RCP IAdaptable
----------------------

The Eclipse concept of IAdaptable is similar to the normal example of a Java interface:

.. code-block:: java

    if( object instanceof WebMapServer ){
       WebMapServer wms = (WebMapServer) object;
       // use wms here
    }

Using IAdaptable this would become:

.. code-block:: java

    if( object instanceof IAdaptable){
       IAdaptable adaptee = (IAdaptable) object;
       WebMapServer wms =
          (WebMapServer) adaptee.getAdapter( WebMapServer.class );
       If( wms != null ){
          // use wms here
       }
    }

Or using IResolve which uses the same general approach:

.. code-block:: java

    if( service.canResolve( WebMapServer.class ) ){
        WebMapServer.class wms = handle.resolve( WebMapServer.class, new NullProgressMonitor() );
        // use wms here
    }
