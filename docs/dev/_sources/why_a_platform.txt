Why a Platform
--------------

The Java GIS community is already host to several open-source toolkits of great capability. These
toolkits provide a great number of services, and allow you the software developer to communicate
with a wide varity of spatial information.

The UDIG framework goes the extra mile, providing a well structured application for you to extend.
As a software developer you can focus on your tasks needed for your problem. The finding, connecting
and display of spatial information can be someone else's problem.

Relationship with Libraries and Toolkits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will find that uDig is set up as a platform allowing you to work "out of the box" with:

-  GeoTools interfaces and implementation

   -  OpenGIS interfaces for commercial standards (OGC) and international standards (ISO)
   -  GeoTools implementations

-  JTS Toplogy Suite: provides the implementation of Geometry (ie the "Shapes") you see on the
   screen

This is by no means a closed set; community plug-ins have experimented with:

-  R for stats analysis
-  C libraries like GDAL and OGR
-  C++ libraries like OSSIM

If you hear of a good toolkit or library please ask on the email list; we would be happy to help you
hook it up.
