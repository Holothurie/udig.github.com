Using Feature operations
########################

Feature operations are available from a number of locations:

-  Listed in the edit menu when a features are selected.
-  from the context menu when features are selected
-  from the menu bar **Edit > All Operations** to open the `Operations
   dialog <Operations%20dialog.html>`_

There are several common ways to select features to work on.

-  Using the `Catalog view <Catalog%20view.html>`_ to open up a service and select the features
   being published
-  Using the `Map editor <Map%20editor.html>`_ and `Selection Tools <Selection%20Tools.html>`_ to
   indicate which features to work on
-  Using the `Layers view <Layers%20view.html>`_ to select a layer (the layer selection will be used
   if provided)
