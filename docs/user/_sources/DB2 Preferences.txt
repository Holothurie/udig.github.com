DB2 Preferences
###############

Since DB2 is a proprietary database uDig is not shipped with the DB2 jdbc drivers. The DB2
preference provides a way to point uDig to the driver jar files.

#. Open the preferences in 1 of the following 2 ways:

   #. If you have never set the jdbc driver before adding a DB2 Layer or importing DB2 service into
      the catalog will open the DB2 preferences page.
   #. Open the Workbench Preferences under **Window > Preferences...**

#. Enter location of the JDBC driver or Browse to the file. The driver is typically called
   db2jcc.jar.
#. Enter location of the license jar or Browse to the file. The driver is typically called
   db2jcc\_license\_cu.jar.
#. Press Apply. This will copy the files into uDig.

#. If you wish to use DB2 press OK to restart application. If the application is not restarted the
   new jars will not be found and exceptions will occur when you try to add layers.
#. If application is restart you may now add DB2 data.

Since the drivers are copied into the uDig updating the drivers will require the following steps:

#. Open the Workbench Preferences under **Window > Preferences...**
#. Select DB2 preferences
#. If the location of the JDBC driver has changed enter new location of the driver or Browse to the
   file. If not leave the saved settings.
#. If the location of the license jar has changed enter new location of the jar fileor Browse to the
   file. If not leave the saved settings.
#. Press apply and agree to restart Application.
