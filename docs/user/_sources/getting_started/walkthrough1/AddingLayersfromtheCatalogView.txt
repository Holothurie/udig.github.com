Adding Layers from the Catalog View
-----------------------------------

In this section you will learn how to add additional layers to your map from a previously connected data source (the DM Solutions WMS).

Adding a Layer from a previously connected WMS:

1. In the :guilabel:`Catalog` view expand the record for the
   :guilabel:`GMap WMS Demo Server` by clicking on the triangle beside the record.

2. Right-click on :guilabel:`Railroads` and select :guilabel:`Add to Current Map`.

3. The new layer will appear in the :guilabel:`Layers` view and automatically start to render.

   When it finishes rendering, you should see a new :guilabel:`Railroads` layer drawn on screen.

4. The catalog also comes equipped with a built in service called :guilabel:`Decoration`.
   
   Select :guilabel:`Decoration > Scalebar` in the :guilabel:`Catalog` view and drag this
   layer onto the Map

   The Scalebar is added to the top left corner of your map.

5. You can now close the Map Editor using the small :guilabel:`x` next to the map name.
  
6. Available maps including this one are shown in the :guilabel:`Projects` view if you
   would like to open your map again.
