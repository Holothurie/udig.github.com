Working with Layers
###################

The concept of a `Layer <Layer.html>`_ is the central method of working with mapping information. A
layer consists of two parts: the data being displayed and the style controlling how the data is
rendered.

* :doc:`Adding a layer`

* :doc:`Change a Layers Style`

* :doc:`Configure a AOI layer`

* :doc:`Create Layer from Query`

* :doc:`Feature count`

* :doc:`Using Layer Operations`


   * :doc:`Validation`


* :doc:`Using Resource Summary`


Please note that you can also work directly with the data used by the layer.
