Using the Legend View
#####################

The Legend View is used to categorize and group layers into folders. In addition, utility features
such as changing the layers' rendering order (z order), toggling layers' visibility in the view and
toggling grid view's visibility on the map are also available. Also, all standard layer operations,
such as changing layer style and zooming to layer, that are available on the Layers View are also
available in this view.
