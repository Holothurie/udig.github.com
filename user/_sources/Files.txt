Files
~~~~~

Individual Files are also represented as a `Service <Service.html>`_ in the `Catalog
view <Catalog%20view.html>`_. You should consider such files as offering a service; you can open the
service to see the contents of the file being made available.

The `File Formats <File%20Formats.html>`_ available in uDig at present are listed here:

* :doc:`GeoTIFF`

* :doc:`GML`

* :doc:`Shapefile`

* :doc:`World Plus Image`
