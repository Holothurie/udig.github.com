Available Preferences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Save Temporary Data Types - When checked temporary feature types that have been defined will be
   saved between sessions. The data is not saved, however, only the feature type definition and the
   entry in the catalog.

   -  Example: If a user creates a new FeatureType via the **Layer > Create** menu item a layer is
      typically added to the open map and an entry is added to the catalog. If this preference is
      not checked the entry will be removed from the catalog on shutdown.
