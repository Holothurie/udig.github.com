~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Hole Cutter tool allows holes to be selected, cut and edited. The hole cutter has the following
functionality:

-  Clicking within an existing polygon will start the creation of a hole. Creating a hole is the
   same as creating a polygon using the Polygon Tool except that creation is restricted to within
   the polygon. Notice that the created vertex is within a selected polygon

-  Clicking an existing hole will select it.
-  Vertices in selected holes can be moved when in Advanced Edit Mode.

-  Vertices in selected holes can be deleted when in Advanced Edit Mode.

-  As with the `Edit Geometry Tool <Edit%20Geometry%20Tool.html>`_ the vertex operations can be
   performed on multiple vertices at once if many vertices are selected.
