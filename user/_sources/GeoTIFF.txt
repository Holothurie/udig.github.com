GeoTIFF
~~~~~~~

A GeoTIFF is a normal TIFF file that has had spatial information encoded in the image metadata
fields.

Please note that a TIFF file may also be used without spatial metadata entries; when combined with a
"world file" it is known as a `World Plus Image <World%20Plus%20Image.html>`_ file.
